## [Developing a Kinetic Incient Tracker] (https://github.com/katgrubbs14/NAV_Capstone)
This is the Capstone project I did at GWU. It was an honor and pleasure that I have the opportunity to work for the Navanti Group with my team. This project is a mix of system engineering and business analytics. To help the analysts out of those tedious daily reading and finding news work, a kinetic incient tracker can increase their efficency. I was able to expand my knowledge learning about natural language processing, name entity recognition, and face daily callenges coders encounter. Final deliverables of this project include a model that can scrape articles both from Pravda news platform and articles retrieved by news API, detailed-oriented user instructions designed for non-tech users and tech users. Please check out the slide to know more details of this project.
