# Business and Data Analyst Portfolio
---
This repository is a portfolio of projects I've completed during school. Their focus either is business analytics, data analytics, or data science. They are in descending order, so the lastest one are on the top. Below are the overview of each project.

This is the Capstone project I did at GWU. It was an honor and pleasure that I have the opportunity to work for the [Navanti Group](https://navantigroup.com/) with my team. 

This project is a mix of system engineering and business analytics. The overall **goal** is to help the analysts out of those tedious daily reading and finding news work, increasing their efficency through using the kinetic incient tracker. I was able to expand my knowledge learning about natural language processing, name entity recognition, and face daily callenges coders encounter. 
Final deliverables of this project include a model that can scrape articles both from Pravda news platform and articles retrieved by news API, detailed-oriented user instructions designed for non-tech users and tech users. Please check out the [slide](https://github.com/graceli01/BDAportfolio/blob/8fd37be9b8e75e5b6872bc76fdfb8a8188c5e00a/Capstone%20Presentation_Kinetic%20Incident%20Tracker.pdf) presentation to know more details of this project.

This project goal is to build an model that can classify whether a particular URL ads is prone to phishing so we can secure customers' privacy. Multiple classifier models are to be built using machine learning on BookMyShow dataset from Kaggle. The best classification model will be selected after each model's accuracy is evaluated.

Methodology:
+ Data Preprocessing & Exploration Analysis
+ Classification Models (Binary Classification)
  + Logistic Regression
  + K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  + Decision Tree
  + Random Forest
+ Model Evaluation Using Test Set
  + 70% training, 30% testing
