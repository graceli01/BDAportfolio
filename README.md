## [Developing a Kinetic Incient Tracker](https://github.com/katgrubbs14/NAV_Capstone)
This is the Capstone project I did at GWU. It was an honor and pleasure that I have the opportunity to work for the [Navanti Group](https://navantigroup.com/) with my team. 
This project is a mix of system engineering and business analytics. The overall **goal** is to help the analysts out of those tedious daily reading and finding news work, increasing their efficency through using the kinetic incient tracker. I was able to expand my knowledge learning about natural language processing, name entity recognition, and face daily callenges coders encounter. 
Final deliverables of this project include a model that can scrape articles both from Pravda news platform and articles retrieved by news API, detailed-oriented user instructions designed for non-tech users and tech users. Please check out the slide presentation to know more details of this project.
