## Business and Data Analyst Portfolio ðŸ“‚

This repository is a portfolio of projects I've completed during school. Their focus either is business analytics, data analytics, or data science. They are in descending order, so the lastest one are on the top. Below are the overview of each project.

## [Developing a Kinetic Incient Tracker](https://github.com/katgrubbs14/NAV_Capstone)
**Languages and Tools**:

This is the Capstone project I did at GWU. It was an honor and pleasure that I have the opportunity to work for the [Navanti Group](https://navantigroup.com/) with my team. 

This project is a mix of system engineering and business analytics. The overall **goal** is to help the analysts out of those tedious daily reading and finding news work, increasing their efficency through using the kinetic incient tracker. I was able to expand my knowledge learning about natural language processing, name entity recognition, and face daily callenges coders encounter. 
Final deliverables of this project include a model that can scrape articles both from Pravda news platform and articles retrieved by news API, detailed-oriented user instructions designed for non-tech users and tech users.

**This project goal** is to build an model that can classify whether a particular URL ads is prone to phishing so we can secure customers' privacy. Multiple classifier models are built using machine learning on BookMyShow dataset from Kaggle. The best classification model is selected after each model's accuracy is evaluated. Besides building classification models, we also learned about what components could potentially indicate a URL is phishing.

Methodology:
+ Data Preprocessing & Exploration Analysis
+ Classification Models (Binary Classification)
  + Logistic Regression
  + K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
  + Decision Tree
  + Random Forest
+ Model Evaluation Using Test Set
  + 70% training, 30% testing
  + evaluated based on classification accuracy

## Supply Management: Seoul Biking Sharing Project
**Languages and Tools**:
<img align="center" height=30 alt="JMP" width="30px"
src="https://mb.cision.com/Public/9602/2082588/92474d4054bf3d17_800x800ar.png" />
<img align='center' alt="Python" width="30px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/python/python.png" />

Compared with traditional urban transportations, shared bikes have significant advantages, including low carbon emission(environmental friendly), healthier lifestyles, less traffic jams and convenience (especially for short distance traveling). According to what we can see in cities and data from Statista , the rental bike business has been thriving worldwide since 2012. More city governments and companies are working to provide such services and it is better for them to know how to allocate the bikes appropriately.

**A goal of this project** is to help predict the required number of rental bikes required daily. We want to see what variables help determine the rented bikesâ€™ amount. The potential benefits of such a model are important not only for city development like public transportation and environmental stability but also for the company's efficiency of allocating bikes (i.e. inventory management). Decision makers could be governmental sectors and/or rental bikes companyâ€™s shareholders.

Methodology:
+ Data Selection: ['Seoul Bike Sharing Demand'](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand) dataset provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository
+ Data Preprocessing & Exploration
+ Prediction Models
  + Linear Regression
  + Decision Tree
  + Bootstrap Forest
  + Neural Networks
+ Model Evaluation Using Test Set
  + 75% training, 25% testing
  + final model chosen based on performance of R-Square and RASE
+ Business Suggestions based on Analysis
